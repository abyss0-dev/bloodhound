# Output Schema: BehaviorEvent

The output schema is defined in `schema.json`. All events emitted by
Bloodhound conform to this structure.

## Implementation Notes

### proc.main_executable and proc.cwd

These fields cannot be reliably obtained from within tracepoint BPF programs.
`bpf_d_path()` is only available in LSM and sleepable program types.

DECIDED approach: populate `proc` fields in userspace by reading
`/proc/<pid>/exe` and `/proc/<pid>/cwd` upon event receipt. For short-lived
processes, this is best-effort (the process may have exited). The `proc`
section is optional in the schema specifically to accommodate this.

### event.type PACKET

DECIDED: In scope. Raw packet capture via TC hooks. See
[tracing.md](tracing.md) for design details. PACKET events use
`event.layer = "behavior"`. `event.name` is `"ingress"` or `"egress"`.

### event.type LSM

DECIDED: LSM events use `event.layer = "behavior"`. LSM hooks both block
operations and emit BehaviorEvents, recording tamper attempts as
observable events.

### event.type SYSCALL

DECIDED: Used for Tier 1 raw_syscalls events. These carry `syscall_nr`
(integer) and `raw_args` (array of 6 integers) in `args`. The
`event.name` is the syscall number as a string (e.g., "83" for mkdir).
`event.layer` is always `"behavior"`.

### event.type KPROBE

DECIDED: Reserved for future use. Not used in the current design. Kept
in the schema for forward compatibility.

### event.type LIFECYCLE

DECIDED: Userspace-synthesised process-lifecycle events derived from
the existing kernel event stream; no BPF capture added. `event.layer`
is always `"behavior"`. Three `event.name` values:

- `process_start` — emitted once, immediately before the first event
  from a previously-unseen `pid`. Carries `args.start_time_ns` (from
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22 converted to wall-clock ns via
  `/proc/stat` `btime` + the fixed 100 Hz tick rate). Best-effort
  `args.main_executable` and `args.cwd` are included when `/proc/<pid>`
  is still readable at observation time. When the process has already
  exited, `args.partial = true` and `args.start_time_ns = 0`. The
  `(pid, start_time_ns)` pair is the recommended stable identity to
  defeat pid reuse within a session.

- `process_fork` — emitted immediately after a successful `clone` or
  `clone3` event (`return_code >= 0`) whose decoded flags do not
  include `CLONE_THREAD`. Carries `args.parent_pid`, `args.child_pid`,
  and `args.clone_flags` (the decoded flag array from the triggering
  event, forwarded verbatim). Thread clones are deliberately filtered
  out because they do not create a new process identity.

- `process_exit` — emitted immediately after a Tier 1 raw-syscall
  event for `exit_group` (syscall 231). Carries `args.pid` and
  `args.exit_code` (from `raw_args[0]`). After emission, the pid is
  removed from the first-seen set so a subsequent reuse of that pid
  number produces a fresh `process_start` with a new `start_time_ns`.

Ordering: `process_start` precedes the triggering event in the output
stream; `process_fork` / `process_exit` follow it. FIFO relative to
the triggering event is preserved.

### event.type HEARTBEAT

DECIDED: Periodic userspace-synthesised pulse. `event.layer =
"behavior"`, `event.name = "heartbeat"`. Emitted every
`--heartbeat-interval` seconds (default: 1.0; set to 0 to disable).

The header fields `auid`, `sessionid`, `pid` are sentinel zeroes and
`comm` is empty — `HEARTBEAT` is not attributable to a process.
`args` carries:

- `drop_count_delta` — drops observed since the previous heartbeat
- `drop_count_total` — cumulative drops since daemon startup
- `events_emitted_delta` — events serialised to stdout in the interval
- `gap_detected` — present and `true` only when
  `drop_count_delta > 0`; omitted otherwise so consumers can
  fast-path on the flag's presence

Downstream consumers should treat any interval between two
`HEARTBEAT` events with `gap_detected = true` as *undecidable* for
correlation — state accumulated across the gap may be incomplete.
