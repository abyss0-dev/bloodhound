# Bloodhound: Technical Specification

> eBPF-based behavioral tracing daemon for isolated VMs.
> All design decisions have been finalized.


## Primary Goal

Trace ALL user-originated actions and their resulting effects within a VM,
and correlate them as a single unified stream of "user behavior." Memory
overhead is acceptable; completeness of observation is the top priority.

## Overview

Bloodhound is a resident daemon that traces user behavior inside isolated
VMs (QEMU/KVM). It captures every kernel-level event attributable to
the target user -- syscalls, TTY I/O, network packets, and process
lifecycle -- correlates them via `auid`, and emits structured events as
NDJSON to stdout.

## Known Limitations

|-------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| io_uring I/O coverage   | DEFERRED | I/O submitted via io_uring rings bypasses syscall tracepoints. `io_uring_setup`/`enter`/`register` remain visible via Tier 1 raw_syscalls; submitted operations are not. See `docs/tracing.md` §Known Limitations §io_uring observation gap. |
| Protocol semantic parse | OUT OF SCOPE | DNS, TLS SNI, HTTP, etc. are emitted as raw packet bytes; downstream consumers parse. See `docs/tracing.md` §Protocol semantic extraction is out of scope. |

## Implementation Roadmap

```
Phase 1: Foundation
  +-- Project scaffold (Aya + Rust workspace)
  +-- auid/sessionid reading from task_struct (shared BPF logic)
  +-- Layer 2: execve tracing (simplest, validates filtering)
  +-- Userspace: ring buffer consumer + NDJSON output

Phase 2: Core Tracing
  +-- Layer 3: raw_syscalls generic capture + rich extraction
  +-- Layer 3: clone/clone3 process tree tracking
  +-- Layer 1: TTY capture (kprobe, raw bytes to ring buffer)
  +-- Userspace: /proc enrichment pipeline

Phase 3: Network + Tamper Resistance
  +-- Packet capture: TC hooks (all interfaces, full payload)
  +-- Userspace: socket-to-packet correlation (4096-entry table)
  +-- LSM hooks: 7 hooks (defense + event emission)
  +-- Daemon identification: PID + bpf_d_path

Phase 4: Integration
  +-- End-to-end testing in VM environment (Ubuntu 24.04, kernel 6.8)
  +-- Performance profiling and tuning
  +-- Output validation against schema.json
